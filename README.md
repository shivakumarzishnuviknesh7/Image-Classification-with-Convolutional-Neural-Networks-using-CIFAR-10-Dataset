Developed an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and dense layers, achieving a high accuracy on the test set. Visualized sample images from the dataset and plotted training and validation metrics to monitor the modelâ€™s performance. Created an interactive visualization of test images with predicted and true labels to demonstrate the model's capabilities.
